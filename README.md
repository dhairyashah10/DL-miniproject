Deep Learning Mini Project:

  The goal of this research was to create a modified ResNet architecture capable of achieving the greatest test accuracy on the CIFAR10 dataset while using no more than 5 million parameters.

  We discovered that a modified ResNet architecture with 74 layers and a broad structure (i.e., more filters per layer) obtained the maximum test accuracy of 91% while having 4.8 million parameters. We also discovered that employing the ReLU activation function and a learning rate schedule that begins with a high learning rate and progressively declines over time is critical for optimal performance.

  Overall, this experiment proved the necessity of careful model design and hyperparameter tweaking in getting acceptable performance on picture classification tasks, especially when limited computing resources and model size are available.
